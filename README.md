- 👋 Hi, I’m @Idris-Elmaliki
- ❤️ I’m interested in front-ended app development, and game-dev.
- 🧠 I’m currently learning kotlin and the Jetpack Compose framework for Frontend App dev, as well as OpenGL for C++ game dev.
- 👨‍💻 I’m looking to create projects and collaborate alongside others to allow me to think better as a programmer.
- 💰 My main goal is to just he able to find a job soon! But overall, programming is quite fun and I hope to get the opportunity to puruse a career in it!!
