- 👋 Hi, I’m @Idris-Elmaliki
- ❤️ I’m interested in Android and Game-dev.
- 🧠 I’m currently learning kotlin and the Jetpack Compose framework for Android App development, as well as OpenGL for C++ game development, but one step at a time.
- 👨‍💻 I’m looking to create projects and collaborate alongside others to allow me to think better as a programmer.
- 💰 My main goal is to just he able to find a job soon! But in all seriousness, programming is quite enjoyable and I hope to get the opportunity to pursue a career in it and be able to create and maintain impactful code!
